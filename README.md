Hello! I'm **Anar Taori**, an AI Product Leader with a deep passion for building software products that solve real-world problems. My background in hands-on AI/ML development coupled with my 10+ years of product management experience provides me with the technical credibility to effectively lead cross-functional teams from concept to launch.

This portfolio is a curated collection of my independent AI/ML work since 2020. The projects featured below are my most comprehensive case studies, documented to showcase the full product lifecycle from problem discovery to final impact.

**A Note on Repositories:** Some of my larger projects, such as full-stack web and mobile apps developed over several months, are kept in private repositories. For these, I have created public "demo" repositories that include detailed video walkthroughs, architecture diagrams, and curated code snippets to provide a comprehensive look into the work.

## üöÄ Additional Projects Catalog

Below is a more comprehensive list of my hands-on projects, demonstrating a broad range of AI/ML skills and applications.

### üß† Generative AI: RAG
#### **GroundedQA**
*   **Problem:** Enterprise users spend hours weekly searching for specific answers. They cannot trust standard LLMs for critical business tasks because they hallucinate, have small context windows, and lack access to private, real-time company data.
*   **Solution:** Built a RAG pipeline that allows enterprise users to ask questions in natural language and gets precise answers with source links 90% of the time.
*   **Tech Stack:** Langchain, OpenAI ChatGPT, ChromaDB, PyPDF, TikToken
*   **[‚û°Ô∏è View Full Case Study & Repository](https://github.com/atcode11/GroundedQA_RAG_Enterprise_Knowledge_Engine)**
---
#### **BigData_RAG**
*   **Problem:** Knowledge workers waste valuable time and make incomplete decisions because they cannot get synthesized, accurate answers from a large and growing library of siloed documents.
*   **Solution:** This RAG pipeline takes in multiple PDF files from a folder and can answer questions based on multiple files with 90% accuracy
*   **Tech Stack:**Python, LangChain, OpenAI API, ChromaDB, PyPDF, Tiktoken
