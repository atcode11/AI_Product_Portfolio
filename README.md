Hello! I'm **Anar Taori**, an AI Product Leader with a deep passion for building software products that solve real-world problems. My background in hands-on AI/ML/GenAI development coupled with my 10+ years of product management experience provides me with the technical credibility to effectively lead cross-functional teams from concept to launch.

This portfolio is a curated collection of my independent AI/ML/GenAI work since 2020. The projects featured below are my most comprehensive case studies, documented to showcase the full product lifecycle from problem discovery to final impact.

**A Note on Repositories:** Some of my larger projects, such as full-stack web and mobile apps developed over several months, are kept in private repositories. For these, I have created public "demo" repositories that include detailed video walkthroughs, architecture diagrams, and curated code snippets to provide a comprehensive look into the work.

## ✨ Featured Projects: Deep Dives

I have showcased five different projects from my portfolio followed by a set of projects which I have made public.

### 1. **InsightBot: The Conversational BI Assistant**
*   **Problem:** Business users need immediate data insights to make timely decisions, but they often lack the technical skills to query databases directly. This creates a dependency on data analytics teams, leading to significant delays and operational friction.
*   **Solution & Result:** Built an autonomous AI agent that translates natural language into self-correcting SQL queries, enabling non-technical users to get business insights in seconds instead of days. The frontend was built using Streamlit.
*   **Tech Stack:** OpenAI, LangChain, SQLite, Python, Streamlit

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis Engine Bake-Off**
*   **Problem:** Product and engineering teams frequently need to understand user sentiment from text data like product reviews, support tickets, or social media comments. While many sentiment analysis tools exist, they vary significantly in their approach, accuracy, and complexity
*   **Solution:** A comparative analysis of four popular NLP libraries (NLTK, TextBlob, Flair, DeepMoji) on a sentence with mixed sentiment, resulting in a data-driven recommendation: use TextBlob for a quick MVP and Flair for high-accuracy production systems.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, NLTK (Vader), TextBlob, Flair (PyTorch), DeepMoji.

### 3. **BigData_RAG**
*   **Problem:** Knowledge workers waste valuable time and make incomplete decisions because they cannot get accurate answers. They cannot trust standard LLMs for critical business tasks because they hallucinate, have limited context windows, and lack access to private, real-time company data.
*   **Solution & Result:** This RAG pipeline takes in multiple PDF files from a folder and can answer questions based on multiple files with 90% accuracy.
*   **Tech Stack:**Python, LangChain, OpenAI API, ChromaDB, PyPDF, Tiktoken

### 4. **TrafficVision AI: Real-Time Fleet & Emergency Vehicle Detection**
*   **Problem:** Fleet managers lack an automated way to track and differentiate specific vehicles in real-time video feeds, causing costly operational inefficiencies and dispatch delays.
*   **Solution & Result:** This project delivers a proof-of-concept for an intelligent vehicle recognition system. It is built by fine-tuning a YOLOv3 model on a custom dataset to recognize critical fleet and emergency vehicles with high speed and accuracy.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, YOLOv3, OpenCV, Computer Vision

### 5. **Data Visualization and Machine Learning Model: Covid19 Impact on US Industry**
*   **Problem:** The pandemic caused record job losses and widespread economic disruption across the United States. Policy makers, investors, and businesses needed evidence-based insight into which sectors would recover fastest — and why.
*   **Solution & Result:**Used Data Science and Machine Learning to visualize and forecast the economic impact of COVID-19, and uncover patterns that explain industry-level resilience.
*   **Tech Stack:**Tableau, Linear and Polynomial Regression, R, Python (Numpy, Pandas)
